# UniPulse – AI-Powered Campus Feedback & Insight System

**Team BugOff | Campus Sigma Hackathon**

---

## Project Overview

**UniPulse** is a Flutter + Firebase–based application that allows **students and professors** to submit campus-related complaints and suggestions. Administrators receive **AI-generated insights** to prioritize and address the most important issues, enabling **data-driven decisions** in educational institutions.

---

## Problem Statement

Students and faculty often face issues related to:

- Infrastructure
- Academics
- Hostels and facilities
- Mental well-being

Challenges include:

- No **unified platform** to collect and analyze feedback
- Genuine complaints may **go unnoticed**
- Repetitive issues are **not identified**
- Authorities lack **actionable insights**

This leads to delayed responses and inefficient decision-making.

---

## Solution

UniPulse provides a **centralized complaint submission and insight system**:

- Collects feedback in one platform
- Analyzes complaints using AI
- Identifies critical and recurring issues
- Helps administrators prioritize action efficiently

---

## System Workflow

1. **Student / Professor** submits a complaint or suggestion
2. Data is stored in **Firebase Firestore** (real-time)
3. **Google Gemini AI** analyzes the submissions
4. AI generates summaries, priorities, and insights
5. **Admin Dashboard** displays AI-driven results
6. Authorities take informed actions
